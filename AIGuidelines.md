ok...how can I set it without sounding too arrogant and cocky? hah...anyways...haters gonna hate so... let's free flow it as it is:

Most of the “AI systems” you see online are just fake eye-candy. Mostly scammy and just want to show you that shit! this can be done soooooooo easily. Look at meee yeeeiiii. They look cool, they sound smart, but they don’t do anything useful when you put them inside a real business.

And I hate to say it but these gurus never actually did a real project themselves. most are like just out of highschool 20-24 years old telling you they landed a 50K a pop restaurant ai voice agent hahaha yeah...sure... if they did they would just be doing that 20 more times easily cause yeah it's easy... and they would be MILLIONAIRES! lol

If you actually want to build stuff that works, here’s the deal.

1) Business isn’t magic. It’s the same steps every time.
Most service companies (and even SaaS, yeah said it) follow the same boring flow:

    Get leads
    Turn leads into sales
    Onboard new clients
    Do the work (fulfillment)
    Win them back later (reactivation)

That’s it. Five steps. You’re not inventing something new. You’re just adding tools that make these steps faster or cheaper.

Where AI/automation really helps:

    Inbound leads: Reply instantly. Book a call fast. People want answers now, not next week.
    Outbound leads: Scrape lists, clean data, send cold emails or DMs.
    Sales: Auto-make proposals, invoices, calendar invites, reminders. Keep CRM updated.
    Onboarding: Payment triggers a welcome email, kickoff call, checklist, portal access.
    Fulfillment: Depends on the work. Could be auto-creating drafts, templates, assets, or tasks.
    Reactivation: Simple check-ins, reminders, win-back messages.

Stop chasing shiny new “steps.” Master these five and you’ll win. I promise.

Seriously, you can try and just login to Upwork and search for job posts about AI. The majority of the serious projects people are actively looking to build and pay for are projects around Sales, Lead Generation and inside automations of their company systems. just go check it yourself...and come back to this post later.

I'm waiting...

ok... you are back.

Let's continue...

2) Simple systems make money. Complex systems break.
Those giant 100-node workflows you see screenshots of? Garbage. They look “impressive” but they’re fragile and annoying.

    Fewer steps = fewer things breaking.
    Simple flows fit into a client’s business without drama.
    Fast delivery = happy client.

Most of the systems I sell are 2–6 steps. Not the most “perfect.” But they make money, they work, and they don’t fall apart.

3) Don’t fall for the hype.
A lot of creators try to make things look harder than they are. Why? To look smarter and sell you stuff.

Reality: you don’t need the newest AI model or a shiny new tool to make money. Yes, new stuff drops every week. It’s “the best” for three days, then something else comes out. Meanwhile, businesses still need the same thing: more revenue and lower costs.

Stick to the basics:

    Does it help bring in money?
    Does it help save money?

If yes, build it. If no, ignore it.

4) Small, boring systems that actually work
Here are a few micro-systems I sell that print cash:

    Speed to lead: Form submit → instant reply → contact in CRM → calendar invite → follow-up if no booking in 15 minutes.
    Proposal flow: Move deal to “Proposal” → doc created → send → track open → nudge if ignored → call if opened twice.
    Onboarding autopilot: Payment → welcome email → checklist → kickoff slot → tasks for team.
    Show-up saver: Every call → SMS + email reminder → confirm check → reschedule if no confirm.
    Reactivation ping: 60 days quiet → send short check-in with real reason to reply.

Each one takes a few steps. Nothing fancy. They just work.

5) Rules I live by when I build and probalby you should too ;-)

    If it doesn’t touch money, it’s not a priority.
    If I can’t explain it in one sentence, it’s too messy.
    If a junior can’t run it, it’s a bad build.
    If one break kills the whole chain, redesign it.
    If it forces the client to hire new staff, we missed the point.

Examples per stage:

    Inbound: Smart auto-reply that qualifies, routes, and books calls.
    Outbound: Scrape leads, clean them, add short lines, send in batches.
    Sales: Auto-create proposals, collect payment, update CRM, fire onboarding.
    Onboarding: Access requests, simple plan, kickoff call, SLA timers.
    Fulfillment: AI draft, assign reviewer, send, ask for feedback.
    Reactivation: 90-day ping with a reason to re-engage.

Nothing crazy. Just simple systems that solve real problems.

Hope that helped in a world of AI craziness and fugazi dreams hahah

Talk soon!
